create a streamlit application that allows a user to specify a folder containing PDF or markdown (.md) files.  once the user clicks "Generate Metadata" on the sidebar, the app delete/recreate a metadata folder under the selected data.
it will then extract the first 2000 characters from the file and send it to the phi4:latest model at http://localhost:11434 using OllamaChatBot with a prompt asking it to translate it to English if needed then to create the following metadata:

{
    "year" : 2005,
    "authors": "Mutchler, Scott and Bodnar, Robert",
    "journal": "Geochimica ...",
    "title": "The geochemical properties of ...",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces..."
}

This metadata will be saved in the metadata folder with the same name as the input file but with .json appended to the name.

Import OllamaChatBot as from vt_ads_common.genai.OllamaChatBot import OllamaChatBot
