The large effect sizes (all d>1.0) indicate clinically meaningful differences beyond statistical significance. The overlapping confidence intervals between Treatment A and B suggest these may be equivalent, while the combination therapy's non-overlapping CI indicates superior efficacy. The modest η²=0.29 suggests treatments explain 29% of response variance, indicating other factors contribute to individual differences. Sample sizes are well-balanced (44-47 per group), supporting statistical validity.",
