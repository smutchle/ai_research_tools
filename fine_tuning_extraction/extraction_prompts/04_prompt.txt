The Hill equation is selected over simpler Emax models because the Hill coefficient (n) can describe cooperative binding (n>1) or complex receptor interactions. The mixed-effects model accounts for repeated measures correlation within subjects while allowing population-level inferences. Model assumptions include: linear kinetics (valid for therapeutic doses), instantaneous distribution (reasonable for this drug's properties), and normal residual distribution (validated by diagnostic plots).",

The output must be pure JSON without any markdown fencing.  Escape any special characters using JSON appropriate escaping.
The output must be JSON only.  Do not include any additional information of any kind.
Don't nest JSON inside the question, answer or reference attributes.
Replace any non-ASCII or special characters with LaTeX (preferred) or simple text equivalent.
You must properly escape any markdown characters that are not allowed in raw JSON.  If you are outputting LaTeX, ensure the backslashes are escaped as double backslashes.
