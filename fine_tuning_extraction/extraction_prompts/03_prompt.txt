      "question": "What culture conditions were used for the stem cell experiments?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- Cell culture: HeLa cells maintained in DMEM + 10% FBS at 37°C, 5% CO₂\n- Treatment conditions: 24-well plates, 5×10⁴ cells/well, seeded 24h before treatment\n- Drug concentrations: 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μM in DMSO (final concentration <0.1%)\n- Incubation time: 48 hours with treatment\n- Viability assay: MTT (5 mg/mL), 4-hour incubation, absorbance at 570 nm\n- Replicates: n=6 biological replicates, each with 3 technical replicates\n\n**Quality Control:**\n- Cell viability >95% at seeding (trypan blue exclusion)\n- DMSO vehicle control included in all experiments\n- Positive control: staurosporine (1 μM)\n- Plate controls: edge effects minimized by using only inner wells\n- Incubator monitoring: temperature ±0.5°C, CO₂ ±0.2%\n\n**Reasoning:** The methodology follows established cell viability protocols with appropriate controls and replication. The 48-hour treatment duration allows sufficient time for drug effects while avoiding confounding from cell confluence changes. DMSO concentration <0.1% prevents cytotoxicity from vehicle. Six biological replicates provide adequate power (80%) to detect 20% differences in viability with α=0.05. Technical triplicates control for pipetting variation. The MTT assay is appropriate for metabolic activity assessment, though it may underestimate cytostatic effects compared to direct cell counting methods.",
