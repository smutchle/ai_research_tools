      "question": "What does Figure 3A show about protein expression levels?",
      "answer": "**Figure 1A - Time Course Analysis:**\nShows exponential decay curve with data points (blue circles) fitted to first-order kinetics model (red line, R²=0.987). Y-axis: normalized response (0-100%), X-axis: time (0-24 hours). Half-life calculated as 4.2 ± 0.3 hours from curve fitting.\n\n**Figure 2B - Dose-Response Relationship:**\nSigmoidal curve spanning 4 log units of concentration (0.01-100 μM). IC50 = 2.3 μM (95% CI: 1.9-2.8 μM), Hill slope = 1.4 ± 0.2. Error bars represent SEM from n=6 experiments.\n\n**Figure 3C - Correlation Matrix Heatmap:**\nDisplays Pearson correlation coefficients between 12 biomarkers. Strong positive correlations (r>0.7, p<0.001) between inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP). Weak negative correlation (r=-0.3, p=0.04) between anti-inflammatory markers and disease severity.\n\n**Figure 4D - Box Plot Comparison:**\nShows median values with interquartile ranges for four treatment groups. Control: 15.3 (12.1-18.7), Treatment 1: 22.8 (19.4-26.2), Treatment 2: 28.1 (24.6-31.5), Combination: 35.2 (31.8-38.9). ANOVA p<0.001, all pairwise comparisons significant.\n\n**Reasoning:** The exponential decay pattern in Figure 1A confirms first-order kinetics, validating the mathematical model used for pharmacokinetic analysis. The high R² value indicates the model explains 98.7% of variance, supporting mechanistic assumptions. The dose-response curve's Hill slope >1 suggests positive cooperativity or multiple binding sites, which aligns with the proposed mechanism of action. The correlation heatmap reveals expected biological relationships - inflammatory markers cluster together, indicating a coordinated immune response. The systematic increase across treatment groups in the box plots demonstrates a clear therapeutic hierarchy, with combination therapy showing additive rather than synergistic effects (observed response approximates sum of individual treatments).",
