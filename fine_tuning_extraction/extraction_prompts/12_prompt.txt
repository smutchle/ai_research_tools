      "question": "What data and code availability supports reproducibility of these findings?",
      "answer": "**Data Availability:**\n- **Raw Data Repository:** Complete dataset (847 GB) deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession: GSE234567)\n- **Processed Data:** Analysis-ready files available on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7891234) including normalized expression matrices and metadata\n- **Clinical Data:** De-identified patient data available through controlled access via dbGaP (study ID: phs002456.v1.p1)\n- **Imaging Data:** Microscopy images (2.3 TB) stored in Image Data Resource (IDR study: idr0089)\n\n**Code Availability:**\n- **Analysis Pipeline:** Complete R analysis pipeline on GitHub (github.com/labname/study2024) with Docker container for environment reproducibility\n- **Custom Software:** Novel peak-calling algorithm implemented as R package 'PeakFinder2024' available on Bioconductor\n- **Machine Learning Models:** Trained models and hyperparameters available on Hugging Face Hub (huggingface.co/labname/biomarker-classifier)\n- **Preprocessing Scripts:** Python scripts for data cleaning and normalization with detailed documentation\n\n**Reproducibility Protocols:**\n- **Standard Operating Procedures:** 47-page SOP document with step-by-step protocols, reagent lot numbers, and equipment specifications\n- **Quality Control:** Pre-specified acceptance criteria for each assay with 15% of samples run in duplicate across 3 independent experiments\n- **Cross-Validation:** Key findings replicated in 2 independent labs (Johns Hopkins, n=45; Stanford, n=52) using shared protocols\n- **Computational Reproducibility:** All analyses run with version-controlled software (R 4.3.1, specific package versions locked with renv)\n\n**Validation Procedures:**\n- **Technical Replicates:** Minimum n=3 technical replicates for all quantitative measurements\n- **Biological Replicates:** Power analysis-determined sample sizes with n≥8 biological replicates per group\n- **Independent Validation Cohort:** Primary findings validated in separate cohort of 156 patients from different institution\n- **Method Validation:** Analytical validation following FDA bioanalytical method validation guidelines\n- **Statistical Validation:** Pre-registered analysis plan (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04567890) with primary/secondary endpoints defined before data collection\n\n**Transparency Measures:**\n- **CONSORT Compliance:** Clinical trial reporting follows CONSORT 2010 guidelines with completed checklist\n- **Conflict of Interest:** Detailed disclosure of industry funding ($2.3M from PharmaCorp) and licensing agreements\n- **Author Contributions:** CRediT taxonomy used to specify individual author contributions\n- **Peer Review:** Post-publication peer review comments and responses made publicly available\n\n**Quality Assurance:**\n- **Lab Certification:** All experiments conducted in GLP-compliant facility with ISO 15189 accreditation\n- **Data Integrity:** Electronic lab notebooks with audit trails, no manual data transcription\n- **Sample Management:** Biobanking with -80°C storage, sample tracking via LIMS system\n- **Inter-lab Standardization:** Ring trials conducted across 5 participating labs with CV<15% for all assays\n\n**Reasoning:** The comprehensive data and code sharing represents best practices in open science, enabling both computational and experimental reproducibility. The multi-institutional validation (Johns Hopkins, Stanford) strengthens confidence in findings beyond single-lab effects. The pre-registered analysis plan prevents p-hacking and selective reporting, while the independent validation cohort guards against overfitting. The combination of technical and biological replicates provides adequate power while controlling for experimental variation. The GLP compliance and ISO certification indicate high data quality standards. However, the controlled access requirement for clinical data, while necessary for patient privacy, may limit some reproducibility efforts. The Docker containerization for computational analysis is particularly valuable as it preserves the exact software environment, addressing a major source of computational irreproducibility.",
