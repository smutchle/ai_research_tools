      "answer": "The study demonstrated three major findings: (1) Treatment group showed 42% improvement in primary outcome compared to control (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.2), (2) Secondary endpoints improved by 28% (95% CI: 18-38%, p=0.003), and (3) Adverse events were reduced by 55% (RR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.32-0.64, p<0.001).\n\n**Reasoning:** These findings represent clinically significant improvements because the effect sizes exceed minimal clinically important differences (MCID>0.5 for primary outcome). The p-values all fall below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (α=0.017 for three comparisons), indicating robust statistical significance. The confidence intervals exclude the null hypothesis values, confirming reliability. The large Cohen's d (1.2) suggests the treatment effect is not only statistically significant but also practically meaningful, as values >0.8 are considered large effects in clinical research.",
