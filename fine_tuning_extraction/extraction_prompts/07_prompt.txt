      "question": "What LC-MS parameters were used for compound identification?",
      "answer": "**Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n- Instrument: Thermo Fisher Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap\n- Ionization: Electrospray ionization (ESI), positive mode\n- Spray voltage: 3.5 kV, capillary temperature: 275°C\n- Resolution: 70,000 at m/z 200 (FWHM)\n- Mass range: 100-1500 m/z\n- AGC target: 1×10⁶, maximum injection time: 100 ms\n- Data acquisition: Xcalibur 4.1, data processing: Compound Discoverer 3.3\n\n**Chromatography Conditions:**\n- Column: Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm)\n- Mobile phase: A) 0.1% formic acid in water, B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile\n- Gradient: 5-95% B over 8 minutes, flow rate 0.3 mL/min\n- Injection volume: 2 μL, column temperature: 40°C\n- Sample preparation: protein precipitation with 3:1 acetonitrile\n\n**Microscopy Setup:**\n- Microscope: Zeiss LSM 880 confocal system\n- Objective: Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 NA oil immersion\n- Lasers: 488 nm (GFP), 561 nm (RFP), 405 nm (DAPI)\n- Detection: photomultiplier tubes with spectral detection\n- Pixel size: 41 nm × 41 nm, z-step: 0.2 μm\n- Image acquisition: ZEN 2.6 software\n- Image analysis: ImageJ/FIJI 1.54f with custom macros\n\n**Spectrophotometry:**\n- Instrument: Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer\n- Wavelength range: 190-1100 nm, bandwidth: 1.5 nm\n- Scan speed: 600 nm/min, data interval: 1 nm\n- Cell path length: 1 cm quartz cuvettes\n- Temperature control: Peltier thermostat ±0.1°C\n- Software: Cary WinUV 5.0.1\n\n**Reasoning:** The Q Exactive Plus was selected for its high mass accuracy (<2 ppm) and resolution capability, essential for confident molecular formula assignment in metabolomics. The C18 UPLC column provides optimal separation for small molecules with the short gradient maximizing throughput while maintaining peak resolution. Confocal microscopy enables optical sectioning to eliminate out-of-focus fluorescence, critical for accurate colocalization analysis. The 63× high-NA objective provides the spatial resolution needed to distinguish subcellular structures. UV-Vis spectrophotometry serves as a complementary quantitative technique with excellent linearity and reproducibility for concentration measurements. All instruments underwent performance qualification according to ICH Q2(R1) guidelines, with system suitability tests performed daily to ensure measurement reliability.",
