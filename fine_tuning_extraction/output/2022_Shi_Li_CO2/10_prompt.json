      "question": "What is a primary limitation of conventional SAFT-type Equations of State (EOSs)?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitations:** Conventional SAFT-type EOSs fail to accurately reproduce the critical pressure and critical temperature of pure compounds.\n\n**Reasoning:** This is a known issue in the field where these models, despite their strengths in liquid density prediction, significantly overestimate critical points, leading to inaccurate predictions near the critical region. The paper highlights this as a key motivation for its research.",

      "question": "What trade-off is involved in existing Critical-Point Perturbed-Chain SAFT (CPPC-SAFT) models?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitations:** CPPC-SAFT, which adjusts parameters to exactly reproduce critical temperature and pressure, achieves this by sacrificing the accuracy of liquid-density predictions.\n\n**Scientific Debates:** This reflects a common challenge in EOS development where optimizing for one set of properties (e.g., critical points) can compromise accuracy for others (e.g., liquid density). The paper explicitly highlights this trade-off as a core motivation for its new model.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper explicitly states that while CPPC-SAFT can reproduce critical points, it leads to a \"significant overestimation of the saturated liquid molar volume\" and inaccurate isotherms in liquid and supercritical phases, as shown in Fig. 2. This \"sacrifice\" is identified as a major limitation that the proposed model aims to overcome.",

      "question": "What are the limitations of traditional Cubic Equations of State (CEOSs) in predicting thermodynamic properties?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitations:** CEOSs (like PR EOS and SRK EOS) employ a universal critical compressibility factor, which does not reflect the true critical compressibility factors varying between compounds, leading to inaccurate predictions of liquid density for pure compounds.\n\n**Methodological Limitations:** CEOS models also frequently fail to provide accurate predictions of thermodynamic properties for complex mixtures and multiphase equilibria, particularly for polar, highly asymmetric, and associated mixtures.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper highlights these limitations as historical issues that prompted the development of more advanced models like SAFT, underscoring the inherent weaknesses of simpler EOS forms when applied to diverse or complex systems.",

      "question": "How does the mean-field theory, underlying SAFT models, limit accuracy near the critical region?",
      "answer": "**Scientific Debates:** SAFT EOS is based on mean-field theory, which neglects the effect of density fluctuations, especially near the critical region. This neglect causes it to overpredict critical temperatures and pressures.\n\n**Methodological Limitations:** The mean-field theory inherently fails to predict the correct thermodynamic properties near the critical region due to the increasing effect of density fluctuations.\n\n**Reasoning:** This is a fundamental theoretical limitation acknowledged in the scientific literature (Sengers, 1999; Hu et al., 2003) and directly impacts the ability of SAFT-type models to accurately represent critical phenomena without specific adjustments or modifications to account for these fluctuations.",

      "question": "What were the limitations of Palma et al.'s approach to incorporating volume translation into PC-SAFT?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitations:** Palma et al. (2018) encountered an \"antagonism\" between the exact reproduction of isobaric expansivity and isothermal compressibility when introducing a constant volume translation. This meant improving one derivative property (dP/dV) degraded another (dV/dT).\n\n**Methodological Limitations:** Their PC-SAFT model's performance was also compromised at high pressures.\n\n**Reasoning:** This illustrates the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing for multiple thermophysical properties with a simple constant volume translation. Such a fixed shift is insufficient to address the complex interplay between different derivative properties or perform reliably across a wide range of pressures, especially high-pressure conditions.",

      "question": "What limitation did Moine et al.'s industrialized volume-translated PC-SAFT (I-PC-SAFT) have regarding density prediction?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitations:** I-PC-SAFT, despite its use of a constant volume translation, could not achieve accurate liquid density prediction, particularly near the critical region.\n\n**Reasoning:** This highlights the insufficiency of a constant volume shift for conditions near the critical point, where properties (like density) are highly sensitive to temperature and require a more flexible, temperature-dependent correction to accurately match experimental data.",

      "question": "What was a key limitation of the temperature-dependent volume translation term developed by Navarro et al. for PC-SAFT?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitations:** While their temperature-dependent correction for PC-SAFT improved density description for some ionic liquids, it was unable to reproduce the critical temperature and critical pressure.\n\n**Reasoning:** This indicates that simply introducing a temperature-dependent volume translation is not a complete solution. For a comprehensive model, it must be coupled with a parametrization method that can simultaneously and accurately reproduce critical points, a gap the current study aims to fill.",

      "question": "What thermodynamic consistency issue is commonly associated with temperature-dependent volume translation models, and how does it affect the proposed VT-CPPC-SAFT model?",
      "answer": "**Controversies/Disputes:** The introduction of temperature-dependent volume translation into EOSs can cause the crossing of isotherms in the pressure-volume diagram (crossover phenomenon), which limits their application range and hinders calculations of other thermophysical properties.\n\n**Methodological Limitations:** The proposed VT-CPPC-SAFT model for CO2 exhibits this crossover issue at pressures above 90.980 MPa (approximately 12.335 Pc) in the temperature range of 0.85 Tc - 0.9 Tc.\n\n**Reasoning:** This is a known issue for temperature-dependent volume translations because different isotherms may require varying degrees of volume shifts, leading to unphysical intersections. The paper quantitatively identifies the pressure limit for its own model's safe application, acknowledging a concrete boundary to its validity and a challenge that must be considered during its use.",

This can lead to concerns regarding the model's extrapolative capabilities beyond the fitted data envelope.",
