      "answer": "**Literature Foundation:**\n- **CPPC-SAFT (Anoune et al., 2021):** Developed to address the failure of conventional SAFT-type EOSs to accurately reproduce critical pressure and critical temperature.\n- **Method:** It adjusts the three parameters (m, r, and e/k) in SAFT-type EOSs to exactly reproduce the critical temperature and critical pressure of pure compounds.\n- **New Limitation Introduced:** This exact reproduction of critical points is achieved by sacrificing the accuracy of liquid-density predictions.
