      "question": "What specific protocols are described to enable the replication of the model's development and parameterization?",
      "answer": "The study details several aspects critical for replication:\n1.  **Base Model Selection:** The use of the perturbed-chain SAFT (PC-SAFT) EOS as the foundational model.\n2.  **Parametrization Method:** The adoption of the parametrization method proposed by Anoune et al. (2021) to exactly reproduce the experimental critical temperature and pressure, referencing their work for polynomial correlations and numerical values of PC-SAFT parameters.\n3.  **Volume Translation Model:** The introduction of a new nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation model (Equation 5) with a Gaussian-like function.\n4.  **Objective Function for Fitting:** The exact objective function (Equation 6) used to minimize deviations and determine the coefficients (A, B, C) for the volume translation term.\n5.  **Data for Fitting:** The temperature and pressure ranges (0.73 T\textsubscript{c} to 0.99 T\textsubscript{c}; 0.7 P\textsubscript{c} to 3 P\textsubscript{c}) and number of data points (236) used for the regression are specified.\n6.  **Regressed Parameters:** All resulting parameters (Table 2) necessary to define the VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS are explicitly provided.",

      "question": "How were the critical point reproduction capabilities of the model validated?",
      "answer": "The model's ability to accurately reproduce the critical pressure and critical temperature of CO\textsubscript{2} was a primary validation criterion. This was achieved by incorporating a parametrization method (from Anoune et al., 2021) that constrains the model to satisfy the conditions where the first and second derivatives of pressure with respect to volume are zero at the critical point (@P/@V|\textunderscore T = 0 and @\textsuperscript{2}P/@V\textsuperscript{2}|\textunderscore T = 0). Initial validation for PC-SAFT (Gross and Sadowski, 2001) showed %ARDs of 2.021 for critical temperature and 9.242 for critical pressure, indicating overestimation, which the new model aims to correct.",

      "answer": "The accuracy of the VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS in predicting density (liquid, vapor, supercritical phases) and vapor pressure for CO\textsubscript{2} was assessed through extensive comparisons against experimental data from the NIST Chemistry WebBook (Linstrom and Mallard, 2005). The primary quantitative metric used was the average absolute percentage deviation (%AAD), calculated as % AAD = 100/N * sum(|Prop\textunderscore exp - Prop\textunderscore calc|/Prop\textunderscore exp). Additionally, qualitative visual comparisons were presented through various figures showing pressure-volume two-phase envelopes, isotherms, and vapor pressure curves (Figs. 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10).",

      "question": "How was the performance of the new model compared to existing models?",
      "answer": "The performance of the newly developed VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS was directly compared with three previously established SAFT-type EOSs: the original PC-SAFT (Gross and Sadowski, 2001), CPPC-SAFT (Anoune et al., 2021), and the industrialized version of PC-SAFT EOS (I-PC-SAFT) (Moine et al., 2019). This comparison was carried out using the %AAD metric for various properties (vapor pressure, saturated densities, phase-specific densities) and also through visual plots, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model in density predictions and vapor pressure accuracy (Tables 3-5, Figs. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10).",

    },
    {
      "question": "What quality control measures or consistency checks were performed on the model, and what limitations were identified?",
      "answer": "A crucial quality control measure for the theoretical model was the evaluation of its thermodynamic consistency, specifically checking for the \"crossover\" issue in pressure-volume isotherms. This was assessed using a criterion previously developed by Shi and Li (2016). The testing revealed that while no crossover issues appeared at pressures below 73.773 MPa (10 P\textsubscript{c}), a crossover did appear at 90.980 MPa (12.335 P\textsubscript{c}) in the temperature range of 0.85 T\textsubscript{c} - 0.9 T\textsubscript{c}. This identified a clear limitation: the proposed VT-CPPC-SAFT model can be safely used only at pressures below 90.980 MPa, which is a transparent disclosure of its valid application range.",

Rigor is demonstrated through the detailed mathematical derivation of the model, the use of a well-defined objective function for parameter regression, and the comprehensive validation against a high-quality, publicly accessible experimental dataset (NIST Chemistry WebBook). The comparative analysis with multiple established models provides strong evidence for the new model's improved performance. Transparency is upheld by explicitly providing all regressed parameters, detailing the parameterization method, and clearly stating the data sources. Crucially, the authors also transparently report the limitations of their model, such as the pressure range beyond which thermodynamic consistency issues arise (crossover phenomenon), which is essential for proper application by other researchers.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any areas where the research could further enhance its rigor and transparency, particularly concerning reproducibility?",
      "answer": "While the mathematical formulation and parameters are well-documented, a key area for further enhancing reproducibility is the explicit sharing of computational code. Although the model can be re-implemented from the provided equations and parameters, sharing the actual scripts or software used for calculations and parameter regression (e.g., on a public code repository like GitHub) would significantly reduce the effort for other researchers to reproduce the exact computational results and would also help verify the implementation details. This would lower the barrier to replication and facilitate broader adoption and testing of the model.",
