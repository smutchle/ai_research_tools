      "question": "What does Figure 1 demonstrate about the original PC-SAFT EOS for CO2?",
      "answer": "**Figure 1 - Comparison of Original PC-SAFT with Experimental Data:**\nThis figure displays the vapor-pressure curve and pressure-volume two-phase envelope for CO2, comparing experimental data (Linstrom and Mallard, 2005) against calculations from the original Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory Equation of State (PC-SAFT EOS) (Gross and Sadowski, 2001). The y-axis represents pressure, and the x-axis represents molar volume. The curves show the phase boundary and saturation region.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** Its primary importance is to highlight a significant limitation of the original PC-SAFT EOS: its failure to accurately reproduce the critical pressure and critical temperature of CO2. This overestimation is clearly visible as the PC-SAFT calculated critical point (the apex of the curve) is shifted upwards and rightwards compared to the expected experimental critical point. This inaccuracy leads to poor predictions of thermophysical properties, especially near the critical region, and motivates the necessity for model improvements.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The clear visual deviation of the PC-SAFT curve from the experimental data, particularly the misplacement of the critical point, directly illustrates the model's deficiency. The larger area enclosed by the PC-SAFT envelope and its higher critical point visually confirm the overestimation of critical temperature and pressure, providing compelling evidence for the need for a more accurate model.",

      "question": "How does Figure 2 illustrate the limitations of CPPC-SAFT EOS regarding density predictions?",
      "answer": "**Figure 2 - CPPC-SAFT EOS vs. Experimental Data:**\nThis figure presents a comparison between the experimental pressure-volume two-phase envelope and two isotherms (at reduced temperatures Tr=0.9 and Tr=1.1) for CO2, alongside calculations from the Critical Point Perturbed-Chain SAFT EOS (CPPC-SAFT EOS) (Anoune et al., 2021). The y-axis shows pressure, and the x-axis shows molar volume.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure is crucial for demonstrating that while CPPC-SAFT successfully reproduces the experimental critical point (unlike the original PC-SAFT shown in Figure 1), this improvement comes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy in liquid-density predictions. It clearly shows a significant overestimation of the saturated liquid molar volume and an inaccurate representation of isotherms in both liquid and supercritical phases.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The visual disparity between the CPPC-SAFT curves and the experimental data, particularly the marked overestimation of the saturated liquid branch and the deviation of the Tr=0.9 and Tr=1.1 isotherms in the liquid and supercritical regions, directly supports the conclusion that accurate critical point reproduction alone is insufficient for precise density predictions. This inadequacy reinforces the study's argument for introducing an additional parameter, such as volume translation, to improve density accuracy.",

      "question": "What insight does Figure 3 provide about the 'needed volume shift' for liquid-phase CO2?",
      "answer": "**Figure 3 - Needed Volume Shift for Liquid CO2 (CPPC-SAFT):**\nThis figure illustrates the difference between reference experimental molar volumes (Linstrom and Mallard, 2005) and molar volumes calculated by the CPPC-SAFT model (Anoune et al., 2021) for liquid-phase CO2 at various constant reduced pressures (e.g., 0.7 Pc, 0.8 Pc, etc.). The y-axis represents the needed volume shift, and the x-axis represents temperature.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** The figure's importance lies in quantitatively and visually identifying the necessary volume correction required for CPPC-SAFT to accurately predict liquid density. It clearly demonstrates a trend where the needed volume shift is not constant but increases significantly with temperature, especially as conditions approach the critical point. This visual evidence directly supports the paper's rationale for developing a *nonlinear temperature-dependent* volume translation model.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The non-linear and increasing pattern of the data points for the 'needed volume shift' as temperature rises, particularly the steepness near the critical point, provides strong visual evidence that a simple constant or linear volume translation would be inadequate. This observed trend dictates the functional form required for the volume translation term in the proposed model.",

      "question": "How does Figure 4 expand upon the concept of 'needed volume shift' for CO2, and what does it imply for model development?",
      "answer": "**Figure 4 - Needed Volume Shift Over Wide Range (CPPC-SAFT):**\nThis figure presents the difference between reference experimental molar volumes (Linstrom and Mallard, 2005) and molar volumes calculated by the CPPC-SAFT model (Anoune et al., 2021) for CO2 over a wide range of temperatures at different constant reduced pressures. The y-axis shows the needed volume shift, and the x-axis shows temperature.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure extends the observations from Figure 3 to a broader temperature range and different phases (liquid and supercritical), reinforcing the substantial and temperature-dependent nature of the required volume correction. It highlights that the existing three-parameter PC-SAFT (even CPPC-SAFT) performs poorly in density reproduction across a wide range of conditions and that the needed shift gradually becomes constant at higher temperatures. This comprehensive view further solidifies the motivation for introducing a nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation to achieve accurate density predictions across all relevant phases.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The sustained and varied pattern of the needed volume shift across different temperatures and pressures, including its tendency to level off at higher temperatures, visually confirms that a sophisticated, nonlinear temperature-dependent function is essential to accurately fit these complex trends. This observation directly informs the design of the Gaussian-like function proposed in the study for volume translation.",

      "answer": "**Figure 5 - Vapor Pressure Prediction Accuracy Comparison:**\nThis figure compares experimental vapor-pressure values (Linstrom and Mallard, 2005) with those calculated by various SAFT-type EOSs: the original PC-SAFT (Gross and Sadowski, 2001), Industrialized PC-SAFT (I-PC-SAFT) (Moine et al., 2019), and the newly developed Volume-Translated Critical-Point Perturbed-Chain SAFT EOS (VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS) from this work. The y-axis represents vapor pressure, and the x-axis represents temperature.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure is crucial for evaluating and validating the vapor-pressure prediction accuracy of the novel VT-CPPC-SAFT model. It visually demonstrates that the VT-CPPC-SAFT (which inherits the accurate critical point reproduction of CPPC-SAFT) provides significantly more accurate vapor-pressure predictions for CO2 compared to the original PC-SAFT. It also shows that its performance is slightly superior to or comparable with the I-PC-SAFT EOS, confirming its robustness in predicting this fundamental thermodynamic property.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The near perfect overlap of the VT-CPPC-SAFT curve with the experimental data, especially when contrasted with the clear deviation of the original PC-SAFT curve, directly illustrates the improved accuracy. The close proximity of the VT-CPPC-SAFT curve to the I-PC-SAFT curve, and its marginal visual advantage, quantitatively supported by the %AAD values in Table 3, confirms its competitive or superior performance.",

The y-axis represents pressure, and the x-axis represents molar volume.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure directly illustrates the core improvement achieved by the VT-CPPC-SAFT model. It visually confirms that the introduction of the new temperature-dependent volume translation significantly enhances the prediction of saturated liquid molar volumes. The VT-CPPC-SAFT curve aligns much more closely with the experimental data on the saturated liquid side compared to the CPPC-SAFT curve, which previously overestimated these values.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The noticeable 'leftward shift' of the saturated liquid branch of the VT-CPPC-SAFT curve compared to the CPPC-SAFT curve, bringing it into closer alignment with the experimental data, visually demonstrates the effectiveness of the volume translation term in correcting density predictions. This provides direct visual evidence of the model's success in addressing the saturated liquid density overestimation issue seen in CPPC-SAFT.",

The y-axis represents the volume shift, and the x-axis represents temperature.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure is pivotal in validating the functional form chosen for the new volume translation model. It demonstrates that the proposed Gaussian-like function is highly effective in capturing the complex and non-linear behavior of the required volume shift. The close agreement between the calculated volume shifts and the practically needed volume residuals across a range of pressures confirms that the model accurately corrects density discrepancies.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The visual proximity and consistent trend of the calculated lines (representing the proposed model's output) with the discrete data points (representing the experimentally 'needed' shifts) strongly indicate that the mathematical function chosen for volume translation is appropriate and robust. This confirms the model's ability to accurately compensate for the inherent density prediction errors of the underlying CPPC-SAFT.",

The y-axis represents liquid density, and the x-axis represents temperature.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure provides compelling visual evidence of the superior accuracy of the VT-CPPC-SAFT model in predicting liquid-phase density across a range of important operating pressures. It directly compares the new model's performance against established models, clearly demonstrating that VT-CPPC-SAFT consistently achieves the best agreement with experimental data, significantly improving upon the CPPC-SAFT's large deviations.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** In each sub-plot, the VT-CPPC-SAFT curve is visually much closer to, or directly overlaps with, the experimental data points compared to the other models. The pronounced deviations of the CPPC-SAFT curves (which largely overestimated liquid volumes, thus underestimating densities) are particularly noticeable. This consistent and superior alignment across multiple pressure conditions quantitatively and qualitatively validates the enhanced accuracy of the VT-CPPC-SAFT for liquid density prediction.",

The y-axis represents pressure, and the x-axis represents molar volume.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure serves to visually explain *how* the temperature-dependent volume translation within VT-CPPC-SAFT works to correct the density predictions of CPPC-SAFT. It illustrates that the VT-CPPC-SAFT effectively 'translates' the density values predicted by CPPC-SAFT along the molar volume coordinate, resulting in a much better match with experimental data (implicitly represented by the corrected curves). This addresses CPPC-SAFT's significant overestimation of saturated liquid molar volume and liquid molar volume near the critical region.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The clear shift of the CPPC-SAFT's saturated liquid branch and isotherms towards lower molar volumes by the VT-CPPC-SAFT model confirms that the volume translation term is successfully adjusting the predicted volumes. This direct visual evidence demonstrates the mechanism by which the fourth parameter improves the model's accuracy, specifically remedying the previously observed deficiencies in liquid volume prediction.",

The y-axis represents pressure, and the x-axis represents molar volume.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure is important for benchmarking the performance of the new VT-CPPC-SAFT model against another well-established, industrialized volume-translated PC-SAFT model. It visually indicates that VT-CPPC-SAFT provides a slightly better performance, especially at conditions close to the critical point. This subtle but noticeable improvement reinforces the superior accuracy achieved by incorporating a nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation over a constant volume translation (used in I-PC-SAFT).\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** While both I-PC-SAFT and VT-CPPC-SAFT show good agreement with experimental trends (implicitly), the VT-CPPC-SAFT curves, particularly near the critical point and along the saturated liquid line, appear to align slightly more precisely. This visual nuance, combined with the quantitative %AAD data presented in Table 5, helps to establish VT-CPPC-SAFT as a marginally more accurate model, especially in critical regions.",

The y-axis represents pressure, and the x-axis represents molar volume.\n\n**Importance and Contribution:** This figure is critical for assessing the thermodynamic consistency and practical application range of the newly developed VT-CPPC-SAFT model. It is used to check for the 'crossover issue' (where isotherms cross each other), which would indicate a lack of thermodynamic consistency and limit the model's validity. The figure demonstrates that the VT-CPPC-SAFT model remains thermodynamically consistent and free from isotherm crossing at pressures below 90.980 MPa, thus defining its safe operating range.\n\n**Reasoning for Interpretation:** The visual absence of any intersecting isotherms at pressures below approximately 90.980 MPa (12.335 Pc) directly confirms the thermodynamic consistency of the model within this range. Conversely, the appearance of isotherm crossings above this pressure clearly delineates the upper pressure limit of the model's reliable application, providing an essential practical boundary for engineers and researchers.",
