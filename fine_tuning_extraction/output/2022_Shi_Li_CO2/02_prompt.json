      "question": "What were the main limitations of conventional SAFT-type EOSs, particularly concerning critical points and liquid density predictions?",
      "answer": "The main limitations of conventional SAFT-type EOSs, such as the original PC-SAFT, are:\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Critical Point Reproduction:** They often fail to accurately reproduce the critical pressure and critical temperature of pure compounds. For CO2, the original PC-SAFT overestimated the critical temperature by 2.021% and critical pressure by 9.242% (Table 1).\n2.  **Sacrifice in Liquid Density Accuracy:** To address the critical point issue, methods like CPPC-SAFT were developed to exactly reproduce critical points. However, this is achieved by sacrificing the accuracy of liquid-density predictions. For instance, CPPC-SAFT led to a large average absolute deviation (%AAD) of 15.073% for saturated liquid density and 12.173% for general liquid-phase density, significantly worse than other models (Tables 4 and 5).\n3.  **Compromised Predictions Near Critical Region:** Because no constraints are applied to the critical region during parameter regression, predictions of vapor pressure and density near the critical region are often inaccurate.\n\n**Reasoning:** These limitations arise because conventional SAFT-type EOSs are based on mean-field theory, which neglects density fluctuations important near the critical region, and their original parametrization methods do not explicitly constrain critical point reproduction. The trade-off between critical point accuracy and liquid density prediction accuracy necessitates additional parameters, such as volume translation, to improve overall performance.",
