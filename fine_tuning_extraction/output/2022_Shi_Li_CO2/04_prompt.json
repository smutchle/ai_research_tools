      "question": "What is the fundamental equation for the residual Helmholtz energy in the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state?",
      "answer": "**Core Model - Residual Helmholtz Energy:**\n$$a_{res} = a_{hc} + a_{disp}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $a_{res}$ = residual Helmholtz free energy (a fundamental thermodynamic potential from which other properties can be derived)\n- $a_{hc}$ = hard-chain energy contribution (represents repulsive forces and chain connectivity)\n- $a_{disp}$ = dispersive energy contribution (represents attractive forces between segments)\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** This equation forms the core of the PC-SAFT equation of state, which is based on Wertheim's cluster expansion of Helmholtz energy and simplified perturbation theory. It models the total residual Helmholtz energy as a sum of contributions from hard-chain interactions (representing the molecular architecture and excluded volume) and dispersive interactions (representing attractive van der Waals forces). The full expressions for $a_{hc}$ and $a_{disp}$ are complex and are detailed in the original PC-SAFT formulation by Gross and Sadowski (2001).\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** The PC-SAFT EOS is chosen due to its wide application in industrial and academic sectors for modeling the phase behavior and thermodynamic properties of various substances. It provides a more physically rigorous basis than traditional cubic equations of state. A key assumption of the underlying SAFT theory is that molecules are represented as chains of spherical segments. However, the original PC-SAFT, based on mean-field theory, tends to overpredict critical temperatures and pressures, necessitating further modifications for accurate predictions near the critical region.",

      "question": "How is the temperature-dependent volume translation term defined in this paper?",
      "answer": "**Volume Translation Definition:**\n$$c(T) = V_{EOS} - V_{exp}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $c(T)$ = temperature-dependent volume translation term\n- $V_{EOS}$ = molar volume calculated by the equation of state (before translation)\n- $V_{exp}$ = experimental molar volume\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** This equation defines the necessary correction (translation) that needs to be applied to the molar volume predicted by an Equation of State (EOS) to match experimental values. It represents the difference between the theoretically predicted volume and the experimentally observed volume. The concept of volume translation, initially proposed for cubic EOSs, aims to improve liquid density predictions without altering vapor pressure calculations, as it translates the pressure-volume isotherm along the volume axis.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** The introduction of a volume translation parameter is motivated by the observation that SAFT-type EOSs, while accurate for many properties, often fail to precisely predict liquid densities, especially when their parameters are constrained to reproduce critical points. The paper highlights that the three-parameter PC-SAFT EOS sacrifices liquid density accuracy when forced to match critical properties. The volume translation serves as a fourth parameter to compensate for this discrepancy and improve volumetric predictions over a wide range of conditions, particularly for liquid and supercritical phases.",

      "question": "What is the first thermodynamic constraint applied at the critical point for parameter fitting in the PC-SAFT EOS?",
      "answer": "**Critical Point Condition 1:**\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V} \\right)_T = 0$$\n\nWhere:\n- $P$ = pressure\n- $V$ = molar volume\n- $T$ = temperature (constant)\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** This equation states that at the critical point, the first derivative of pressure with respect to volume at constant temperature is zero. Graphically, this corresponds to an inflection point with a horizontal tangent on a P-V isotherm. It signifies the point where the distinction between liquid and vapor phases disappears.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** SAFT-type equations of state, being based on mean-field theory, inherently neglect density fluctuations in the critical region, leading to an overprediction of critical temperatures and pressures compared to experimental values. To overcome this limitation and ensure that the PC-SAFT model accurately reproduces the experimental critical point ($T_c$ and $P_c$), this thermodynamic constraint, along with the second derivative condition, is applied during the parametrization process. This method, adopted from Anoune et al. (2021), forces the EOS to pass through the true critical point, which is crucial for accurate predictions of thermophysical properties near and beyond the critical region.",

Combined with the first derivative condition, it precisely defines the inflection point where the critical isotherm has a horizontal tangent, signifying the point of maximum stability for a single phase that can exist as both liquid and vapor.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** Similar to the first critical point condition, this constraint is essential for ensuring the PC-SAFT EOS accurately reproduces the experimental critical temperature and pressure. By incorporating both first and second derivative conditions into the parameterization procedure (as proposed by Anoune et al., 2021), the model's fundamental parameters ($m, r, \\epsilon/k$) are adjusted to exactly match the known critical properties. This strategy directly addresses the deficiency of traditional SAFT models that typically overestimate critical points due to their mean-field theoretical basis, thereby improving the predictive capability of the EOS, especially in the vicinity of the critical region.",

      "question": "What is the new nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation model proposed in this paper?",
      "answer": "**Proposed Nonlinear Temperature-Dependent Volume Translation Model:**\n$$c(T_r) = A \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(T_r - 1)^2}{2B^2} \\right) + C$$\n\nWhere:\n- $c(T_r)$ = temperature-dependent volume translation term\n- $T_r$ = reduced temperature ($T/T_c$), dimensionless\n- $A, B, C$ = coefficients determined by minimizing an objective function (Eq. 6) from experimental data\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** This equation proposes a Gaussian-like function with a \"bell curve\" shape as the volume translation model. It is symmetric around $T_r=1$ (the critical reduced temperature). The form is chosen to capture the observed non-linear behavior of the \"needed volume shift\" (difference between experimental and EOS-predicted volumes), which is significant near the critical point and tends to become constant away from it (as shown in Figures 3 and 4 of the paper). The exponential term provides the strong temperature dependency near $T_r=1$, while the constant $C$ accounts for the baseline shift at temperatures far from the critical point.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** Traditional constant or linear temperature-dependent volume translation models were found insufficient to accurately capture the complex temperature dependence of the needed volume shift for CO$_2$, especially near the critical region. This nonlinear form is specifically selected to improve density predictions over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, by precisely fitting the overall trend of the volume residuals. The selection is empirical, based on observations from density data for CO$_2$, and is designed to complement the PC-SAFT EOS parameters that are constrained to reproduce critical points.",

      "question": "What objective function is used to determine the coefficients of the proposed volume translation model?",
      "answer": "**Objective Function for Parameter Regression:**\n$$OF = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum \\left( \\frac{V_{exp} - V_{EOS}}{V_{EOS}} \\right)^2$$\n\nWhere:\n- $OF$ = objective function to be minimized\n- $N$ = number of data points considered for regression\n- $V_{exp}$ = experimental molar volume\n- $V_{EOS}$ = molar volume calculated by the PC-SAFT EOS before volume translation (i.e., the untranslated volume from the CPPC-SAFT model).\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** This objective function is a form of the sum of squared relative errors (or mean squared relative error). It aims to minimize the average squared percentage deviation between the experimental molar volumes and the molar volumes predicted by the PC-SAFT equation of state (before applying the volume translation). By minimizing this function, the coefficients $A, B, C$ of the volume translation model (Eq. 5) are optimized to best fit the observed differences between the calculated and experimental volumes.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** This least-squares approach is a standard statistical method for fitting empirical parameters to experimental data. The choice of relative error (dividing by $V_{EOS}$) ensures that larger deviations at higher volumes do not disproportionately dominate the optimization, providing a more balanced fit across the data range. The regression is performed using liquid molar volume residuals over specific temperature and pressure ranges (0.73 $T_c$ to 0.99 $T_c$ and 0.7 $P_c$ to 3 $P_c$) to ensure the volume translation effectively corrects the liquid density predictions, especially near the critical point where the original PC-SAFT model struggles.",

      "question": "How is the performance of the PC-SAFT models evaluated in terms of accuracy?",
      "answer": "**Performance Evaluation Metric - Average Absolute Percentage Deviation (%AAD):**\n$$\\% AAD = \\frac{100}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left| \\frac{Prop_{i,exp} - Prop_{i,calc}}{Prop_{i,exp}} \\right|$$\n\nWhere:\n- % AAD = Average Absolute Percentage Deviation\n- $N$ = number of data points\n- $Prop_{i,exp}$ = experimental property value at data point $i$ (e.g., density, vapor pressure) retrieved from the NIST database\n- $Prop_{i,calc}$ = property value calculated by the EOS model at data point $i$\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** The %AAD is a widely used statistical metric to quantify the average relative error between predicted and experimental values. It calculates the absolute difference between each calculated and experimental data point, divides it by the experimental value (to normalize), sums these relative deviations, and then averages them over all data points. Multiplying by 100 converts it to a percentage.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** The %AAD is chosen as the primary metric because it provides a clear and interpretable measure of model accuracy across different properties and scales. It is robust to outliers compared to squared error metrics when large errors are not desired to be heavily penalized. This metric allows for direct comparison of the proposed VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS with existing models (original PC-SAFT, CPPC-SAFT, I-PC-SAFT) in predicting various thermophysical properties of CO$_2$, including vapor pressure, saturated densities, and densities in liquid, vapor, and supercritical phases, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the model's improvements.",

      "question": "What parametrization method is used to obtain the PC-SAFT parameters for the critical-point constrained model (CPPC-SAFT)?",
      "answer": "**Parametrization Method - Critical Point Constrained PC-SAFT (CPPC-SAFT):**\nWhile not a single mathematical equation, this is a theoretical relationship defining how the fundamental parameters of the PC-SAFT EOS are determined:\n\nThe three intrinsic PC-SAFT parameters ($m$, segment number; $r$, segment diameter; and $\\epsilon/k$, energy parameter) are not directly fitted to vapor pressure and liquid density data as in the original PC-SAFT. Instead, they are expressed as functions of known experimental critical properties: critical temperature ($T_c$), critical pressure ($P_c$), and the acentric factor ($\\omega$) of the pure substance. This means the model parameters are adjusted such that the EOS explicitly satisfies the critical point conditions ($\\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V} \\right)_T = 0$ and $\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial V^2} \\right)_T = 0$) at the experimental $T_c$ and $P_c$.\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** This method leverages the universal nature of critical points. By using $T_c$, $P_c$, and $\\omega$ as inputs, the parametrization becomes more generalized. The relationship between these macroscopic critical properties and the microscopic PC-SAFT parameters is derived through solving the critical point conditions for the specific EOS. Anoune et al. (2021) developed the specific polynomial correlations for various substances to achieve this.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** The original PC-SAFT and most SAFT-type EOSs based on mean-field theory tend to significantly overestimate critical temperatures and pressures. This leads to inaccurate predictions near the critical region. The CPPC-SAFT parametrization method is adopted precisely to overcome this limitation by forcing the EOS to exactly reproduce the experimental critical point. This ensures better accuracy for properties like vapor pressure and density near the critical region. However, the paper notes that this method, on its own, might lead to a sacrifice in liquid density prediction accuracy, which is why the volume translation is subsequently introduced.",

      "answer": "**Relationship between Molar Volume and Density:**\n$$\\rho = \\frac{M}{V}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\rho$ = density (e.g., kg/m$^3$ or mol/L)\n- $M$ = molar mass of the substance (kg/mol or g/mol)\n- $V$ = molar volume (e.g., m$^3$/mol or L/mol)\n\n**Underlying Mathematical Principle:** Density is defined as mass per unit volume. In the context of an EOS, which typically calculates molar volume ($V$), the density ($\\rho$) can be directly obtained by dividing the molar mass ($M$) of the compound by its molar volume. This is a fundamental conversion used throughout the paper to relate the EOS output (molar volume) to reported experimental densities.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** Equations of State are designed to describe the relationship between pressure, volume (or molar volume), and temperature (PVT relationships). Therefore, the primary output of an EOS regarding volumetric properties is molar volume. This simple algebraic conversion is applied universally. No specific assumptions are made here beyond the definition of density itself; it's a standard conversion for evaluating the accuracy of volumetric predictions.",

The principle is to directly add a temperature-dependent correction term to the molar volume predicted by the original EOS. This additive correction shifts the entire pressure-volume isotherm along the volume axis, thereby improving volumetric predictions without affecting the vapor pressure calculations, which are determined by the equality of chemical potentials (derived from the Helmholtz energy) and thus independent of a simple volume shift.\n\n**Reasoning for Model Selection and Mathematical Assumptions:** This model structure is chosen to combine the strengths of two improvements: (1) the ability of CPPC-SAFT to exactly reproduce critical temperature and pressure, and (2) the ability of the proposed nonlinear volume translation to accurately predict liquid and supercritical phase densities. The motivation is to overcome the compromise inherent in previous SAFT models, where accurate critical point reproduction often came at the cost of liquid density accuracy. The assumption is that an additive volume shift is sufficient to correct volumetric errors across different phases, and that the chosen Gaussian-like function (for $c(T_r)$) adequately captures the complex temperature dependence of these errors.",
