      "question": "What was the main limitation of conventional SAFT-type equations of state (EOSs) for pure compounds, particularly carbon dioxide?",
      "answer": "The main limitation of conventional SAFT-type EOSs is their inability to accurately reproduce the critical pressure (Pc) and critical temperature (Tc) of pure compounds. For instance, the original PC-SAFT EOS overestimated the critical temperature of CO2 by 2.021% Average Relative Deviation (%ARD) and the critical pressure by 9.242%ARD compared to measured values.\n\n**Reasoning:** The abstract and introduction clearly state that conventional SAFT-type EOSs \"fail to accurately reproduce the critical pressure and critical temperature of pure compounds.\" Table 1 provides the specific quantitative deviations for CO2 using the original PC-SAFT, showing %ARD values of 2.021 for Tc and 9.242 for Pc, which are significant overestimations, leading to inaccuracies near the critical region.",

      "question": "What was the main limitation of the Critical-Point PC-SAFT (CPPC-SAFT) EOS by Anoune et al. (2021) regarding liquid density predictions?",
      "answer": "While the CPPC-SAFT EOS (Anoune et al., 2021) successfully reproduced the experimental critical point for CO2, it did so at the expense of accuracy in liquid-density predictions. Specifically, it resulted in a significant overestimation of the saturated liquid molar volume and inaccurate representation of isotherms, particularly in the liquid and supercritical phases, leading to a large average absolute percentage deviation (%AAD) of 12.173% for liquid-phase density.\n\n**Reasoning:** Section 2.1 states that the exact reproduction of the critical point by CPPC-SAFT EOS is \"achieved at the expense of sacrificing the accuracy of liquid-density predictions.\" Fig. 2 visually demonstrates the \"significant overestimation of the saturated liquid molar volume.\" Table 5 quantifies this, showing CPPC-SAFT with a 12.173% AAD for liquid density, which is considerably higher than other models, confirming the trade-off.",

      "answer": "The study proposed a new model called Volume-Translated and Critical-Point PC-SAFT (VT-CPPC-SAFT) EOS. This model introduces a nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation, designed as a Gaussian-like function (c(Tr) = Aexp(-((Tr-1)^2)/(2B^2)) + C), into the PC-SAFT EOS. This allows the model to simultaneously reproduce the experimental critical temperature and critical pressure while significantly improving the accuracy of density predictions across liquid, vapor, and supercritical phases.\n\n**Reasoning:** The abstract explicitly states, \"a new nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation model is introduced into the perturbed-chain SAFT EOS (PC-SAFT EOS) for more accurate prediction of CO2 density.\" Section 3.1 details the proposed model, VT-CPPC-SAFT, and provides the mathematical form of the Gaussian-like volume translation function (Eq. 5), explaining its purpose to capture the needed volume shift trend (Figs. 3 and 4) and improve density prediction.",

Therefore, the proposed model can be safely used only at pressures below 90.980 MPa.\n\n**Reasoning:** Section 4.4, titled \"Thermodynamic consistency,\" directly addresses this.

      "answer": "The new VT-CPPC-SAFT model solves the issue where previously, SAFT-type EOSs could either accurately reproduce critical points (like CPPC-SAFT) or accurately predict liquid densities (like original PC-SAFT to some extent), but not both simultaneously. CPPC-SAFT accurately reproduced critical points but significantly overestimated liquid molar volumes (12.173% AAD for liquid density).

Section 2.1 explicitly states this for CPPC-SAFT: \"the exact reproduction of critical point by the CPPC-SAFT EOS is achieved at the expense of sacrificing the accuracy of liquid-density predictions.\" The overall conclusion (Section 5) clearly states that three-parameter SAFT-type EOSs \"are unable to provide accurate predictions of density and critical properties simultaneously\" and then emphasizes that VT-CPPC-SAFT \"not only provides accurate predictions of CO2 density... but also exactly reproduces the critical temperature and critical pressure of CO2.\"",

      "question": "What is the main advantage of the proposed VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS compared to existing industrialized version of PC-SAFT (I-PC-SAFT) EOS?",
      "answer": "The main advantage of VT-CPPC-SAFT over I-PC-SAFT is its superior accuracy in density predictions, especially for liquid and supercritical phases, and vapor pressure. While I-PC-SAFT uses a constant volume shift, VT-CPPC-SAFT employs a more sophisticated nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation. This results in VT-CPPC-SAFT achieving an overall %AAD of 1.078% for density, which is better than I-PC-SAFT's 1.477%. Specifically, VT-CPPC-SAFT's vapor pressure %AAD (0.247%) is slightly better than I-PC-SAFT (0.489%), and its liquid density %AAD (0.697%) and supercritical density %AAD (1.282%) are significantly better than I-PC-SAFT (1.621% and 1.475% respectively).\n\n**Reasoning:** Section 4.3 and Table 5 compare VT-CPPC-SAFT and I-PC-SAFT directly, showing VT-CPPC-SAFT's consistently lower %AADs for overall density, liquid density, and supercritical density. Section 4.1 and Table 3 also show a slight improvement for vapor pressure. The motivation in Section 2.2 states that I-PC-SAFT's constant volume translation still resulted in \"an accurate prediction of liquid density cannot be obtained... especially near the critical region,\" which VT-CPPC-SAFT addresses with its nonlinear approach.",

      "answer": "The introduction of the volume translation model in VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS does not cause any changes in the vapor pressure calculations compared to the base CPPC-SAFT EOS. This is a known characteristic of volume translation techniques, as they primarily translate the molar volume curve along the molar volume coordinate without affecting vapor-liquid equilibrium conditions. Consequently, the vapor pressures calculated by VT-CPPC-SAFT are identical to those predicted by CPPC-SAFT.\n\n**Reasoning:** Section 4.1 explicitly states, \"SAFT-type EOSs and CEOSs, coupled with a constant volume translation or temperature-dependent volume translation, predict the same vapor pressures\" and \"the predicted molar volume curve is translated along the molar volume coordinate without causing any changes in the vapor pressure.\" It concludes that \"the vapor pressures calculated with the VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS in this study should be the same as those predicted by the CPPC-SAFT EOS (Anoune et al., 2021).\"",

      "answer": "The Gaussian-like function used for the volume translation model (c(Tr) = Aexp(-((Tr-1)^2)/(2B^2)) + C) is symmetric with respect to a reduced temperature (Tr) of 1. This design implies that the proposed volume translation is a strong function of temperature near the critical point (Tr=1), where density fluctuations are significant and the needed volume shift is large. As the temperature moves away from the critical temperature, this term gradually tends to become a constant value, accurately reflecting the observed trend of volume residuals and leading to better density predictions over a wide range.\n\n**Reasoning:** Section 3.1 describes the properties of the proposed Gaussian-like function: \"This mathematical function is symmetric with respect to Tr=1. Thus, the proposed volume translation is a strong function of the temperature near the critical point, and then this term tends to become a constant value when the temperature is away from the critical temperature.\" This design directly addresses the trend shown in Figs. 3 and 4, where the needed volume shift varies significantly near the critical point but stabilizes further away.",
