      "question": "What primary computational models were developed and evaluated in this study?",
      "answer": "**Computational Models:**\n- **Developed Model:** Volume-translated and Critical-Point Perturbed-Chain SAFT EOS (VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS).\n- **Reference Models for Comparison:**\n  - Original Perturbed-Chain SAFT EOS (PC-SAFT) (Gross and Sadowski, 2001).\n  - Critical-Point Perturbed-Chain SAFT EOS (CPPC-SAFT) (Anoune et al., 2021).\n  - Industrialized version of PC-SAFT EOS (I-PC-SAFT) (Moine et al., 2019).\n\n**Reasoning:** The study aimed to overcome limitations of existing SAFT-type EOSs, specifically their inability to simultaneously accurately reproduce critical pressure/temperature and liquid density. The VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS was developed to address this by introducing a new volume translation model, while the other models served as benchmarks to demonstrate the improvements achieved.",

      "question": "What was the core mathematical modification introduced in the proposed VT-CPPC-SAFT EOS?",
      "answer": "**Core Mathematical Modification:**\n- **Concept:** Introduction of a new nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation model.\n- **Function Type:** Gaussian-like function with a \"bell curve\" shape.\n- **Equation:** `c(Tr) = A * exp(-((Tr - 1)^2) / (2 * B^2)) + C` (Eq. 5)\n- **Parameters (for CO2):** A = 3.16100, B = 0.08094, C = 4.39800 (Table 2)\n\n**Reasoning:** Previous models struggled to accurately predict liquid density, especially near the critical region, even when critical points were reproduced. The empirical analysis of the \"needed volume shift\" (Figs. 3 and 4) showed a nonlinear, temperature-dependent trend that could not be adequately fitted by constant or linear models. The Gaussian-like function was chosen because its shape better captures this observed trend, being strongly temperature-dependent near the critical point (Tr=1) and becoming constant further away.",

      "question": "How were the parameters for the PC-SAFT component of the VT-CPPC-SAFT model determined?",
      "answer": "**PC-SAFT Parameterization Method:**\n- **Method:** The parametrization proposed by Anoune et al. (2021) was selected.\n- **Inputs:** Experimental critical pressure (Pc), critical temperature (Tc), and acentric factor (x) for a pure substance.\n- **Output:** The three PC-SAFT parameters: segment number (m), segment diameter (r), and energy parameter (e/k).\n- **Specific Values for CO2:** m = 2.66827, r = 2.61212 Ã…, e/k = 147.234 K (Table 2).\n\n**Reasoning:** This method was chosen because it ensures the exact reproduction of experimental critical points (critical temperature and critical pressure), which is a crucial aspect that conventional SAFT-type EOSs often fail to achieve without sacrificing other property predictions. Its universality, as critical properties are readily available for various substances, was also a factor.",

      "answer": "**Parameter Regression Method:**\n- **Objective:** To determine the three coefficients (A, B, C) in the Gaussian-like volume translation function (Eq. 5).\n- **Methodology:** Minimization of an objective function (OF).\n- **Objective Function (OF):** `OF = (1/N) * sum(( (V_exp - V_EOS) / V_EOS )^2)` (Eq. 6), where N is the number of data points, V_exp is the experimental molar volume from NIST, and V_EOS is the molar volume calculated by the EOS.\n- **Data Points Used:** 236 data points along eight isotherms.\n- **Regression Conditions (Temperature Range):** 0.73 Tc to 0.99 Tc (equivalent to 225 K to 300 K for CO2).\n- **Regression Conditions (Pressure Range):** 0.7 Pc to 3 Pc (equivalent to 5.164 MPa to 22.132 MPa for CO2).\n\n**Reasoning:** This method directly targets the improvement of density prediction by minimizing the deviation between the model's calculated molar volumes and experimental values, particularly focusing on the liquid phase where volume translation is most impactful and the critical region where deviations are most significant. The specific temperature and pressure ranges were chosen to cover the liquid phase and near-critical conditions relevant for CO2 applications.",

It also performs slightly better than the I-PC-SAFT EOS, with the curves almost overlapping, implying minimal deviation.\n\n**Reasoning:** Volume translation models generally do not affect vapor pressure calculations because they translate the molar volume curve without altering the pressure at a given temperature. The accuracy achieved by VT-CPPC-SAFT in vapor pressure is a direct result of the underlying CPPC-SAFT framework's ability to reproduce critical points, which in turn improves vapor pressure prediction near the critical region.",

While CPPC-SAFT shows excellent performance for saturated vapor density, the overall improvement provided by VT-CPPC-SAFT, especially in liquid density, makes it superior for combined saturated phase predictions.",
