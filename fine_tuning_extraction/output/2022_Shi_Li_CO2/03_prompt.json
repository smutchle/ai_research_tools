      "question": "What was the primary objective of this study regarding the PC-SAFT equation of state for carbon dioxide?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- Introduction of a new nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation model into the perturbed-chain SAFT EOS (PC-SAFT EOS) for carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Conventional SAFT-type EOSs (like original PC-SAFT) fail to accurately reproduce the critical pressure and critical temperature of pure compounds and compromise liquid-density prediction when adjusted to do so (e.g., CPPC-SAFT).\n- The goal was to develop a model that could accurately predict CO₂ density across different phase states (liquid, vapor, supercritical) while simultaneously and accurately reproducing its critical pressure and critical temperature. A fourth parameter, volume translation, was deemed indispensable to achieve this balance.",

      "question": "What initial equation of state was modified, and what were its base parameters for CO₂?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- The original perturbed-chain SAFT (PC-SAFT) EOS, as developed by Gross and Sadowski (2001), was used as the foundational model.\n- For CO₂, the three parameters in the original PC-SAFT EOS were: m (segment number) = 2.0729, r (segment diameter) = 2.7852 Å, and e/k (energy parameter) = 169.21 K.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- PC-SAFT is a well-established and widely applied SAFT-type EOS. However, it significantly overestimates critical points (e.g., 2.021% ARD for Tc and 9.242% ARD for Pc for CO₂) and impacts molar volume predictions near the critical region, necessitating modification.",

      "question": "How was the reproduction of critical points ensured in the modified PC-SAFT EOS?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- The parametrization method proposed by Anoune et al. (2021) was adopted. This method constrains the three PC-SAFT parameters (m, r, e/k) to exactly reproduce the experimental critical temperature (Tc), critical pressure (Pc), and acentric factor (x) of pure compounds.\n- For CO₂, the optimized parameters obtained using this method (CPPC-SAFT) were: m = 2.66827, r = 2.61212 Å, and e/k = 147.234 K.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Most SAFT-type EOSs based on mean-field theory tend to overestimate the critical temperature and pressure due to neglecting density fluctuations near the critical region. This parametrization method provides a universal and effective way to force the model to match true critical points.",

      "question": "What specific limitation of the critical-point PC-SAFT (CPPC-SAFT) EOS led to the introduction of volume translation?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- Although the CPPC-SAFT EOS (using Anoune et al.'s parametrization) accurately reproduced the experimental critical point for CO₂,\n- It exhibited a significant overestimation of the saturated liquid molar volume and could not accurately represent isotherms at Tr=0.9 and Tr=1.1, especially in the liquid and supercritical phases.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The exact reproduction of the critical point by CPPC-SAFT was achieved at the expense of sacrificing the accuracy of liquid-density predictions, indicating a clear need for an additional parameter to improve density description.",

    {
      "question": "Describe the mathematical form of the introduced volume translation model and the rationale for its choice.",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- A fourth parameter, a nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation term, c(T), was introduced.\n- Its mathematical form is a Gaussian-like function with a \"bell curve\" shape: `c(Tr) = A * exp(-((Tr - 1)^2) / (2 * B^2)) + C` (Eq. 5), where Tr is the reduced temperature, and A, B, and C are coefficients.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Analysis of the \"needed volume shift\" (difference between experimental and predicted molar volumes) for liquid-phase CO₂ showed a strong temperature dependency near the critical point, gradually becoming constant away from it.\n- Constant or linear temperature-dependent volume translations could not accurately fit this overall trend.\n- The Gaussian-like function was chosen because it is symmetric with respect to Tr=1 (the critical temperature), meaning it is a strong function of temperature near the critical point and tends to a constant value when the temperature is far from the critical temperature, thus effectively matching the observed molar volume residuals.",

      "question": "How were the coefficients (A, B, C) for the nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation model determined for CO₂?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- The three coefficients (A, B, C) were determined by minimizing the following objective function (OF) (Eq. 6): `OF = (1/N) * Σ [(V_exp - V_EOS) / V_EOS]^2`.\n- This minimization was performed based on 236 data points of liquid molar volume residuals for CO₂.\n- The data points were retrieved from the NIST database (Linstrom and Mallard, 2005).\n- The regression was performed over a temperature range of 0.73 Tc to 0.99 Tc (225 K to 300 K) and a pressure range of 0.7 Pc to 3 Pc (5.164 MPa to 22.132 MPa), covering 8 isotherms.\n- The re-optimized coefficients for CO₂ were: A = 3.16100, B = 0.08094, C = 4.39800.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The objective function aims to minimize the average relative deviation in molar volume, focusing on the accuracy of density predictions.\n- The selected temperature and pressure ranges are crucial because this is where the liquid density predictions are most challenging and where the volume translation is most needed and variable.",

Therefore, the vapor pressures calculated by VT-CPPC-SAFT are inherently the same as those predicted by CPPC-SAFT (which prioritizes critical point reproduction and thus accurate vapor pressure).",
