      "question": "What are the average relative deviations (ARD%) for liquid density predictions using the ePC-SAFT model for single-salt solutions?",
      "answer": "The average relative deviations for liquid density predictions using the ePC-SAFT model for single-salt solutions of various salts are as follows:\n\n| Salt | Average Relative Deviation (ARD%) |\n|:-----|:----------------------------------|\n| NaBr | 1.13%                             |\n| KCl  | 0.70%                             |\n| NaCl | 1.02%                             |\n| Na₂SO₄ | 0.36%                             |\n\n**Reasoning:** These low average relative deviation values (all below 1.2%) indicate that the ePC-SAFT model provides promising accuracy for predicting the liquid density of these common single-salt solutions.
