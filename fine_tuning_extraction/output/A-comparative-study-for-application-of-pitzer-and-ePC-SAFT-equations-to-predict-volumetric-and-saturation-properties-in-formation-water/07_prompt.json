      "question": "What was the 'second strategy' for ePC-SAFT parameter calculation from Held et al. [34] applied in this work?",
      "answer": "**Strategy Description:**\n- **Repulsion:** Accounted for repulsion among ions and between solvents and ions.\n- **Dispersion Interactions:** Explicitly considered dispersion interactions between anions and cations. Dispersion between two anions or two cations was NOT considered.\n- **Ion Structure:** Each ion was regarded as a single particle (m\\u2092\\u2082\\u2098\\u2094 was set to 1).\n- **Ion Diameters:** Diameters of solvated ions were assumed to be temperature independent.\n- **Electrostatic Interactions:** Described by a Debye-H\\u00fcckel contribution to the residual Helmholtz energy.\n- **Dielectric Constant:** Assumed to depend only on solvent and temperature, independent of salt or acid.\n\n**Difference from First Strategy (Held et al. [1]):** The key difference is the explicit consideration of dispersion interactions among ions (specifically between anions and cations) in the second strategy, which was not accounted for in the first.",

      "question": "What was the overall conclusion regarding the predictive capabilities of the Pitzer and ePC-SAFT models?",
      "answer": "**Pitzer Model:**\n- Provided acceptable prediction accuracy for solubility of different single-salt and two-salt brines.\n- In some cases, performed better than ePC-SAFT for solubility prediction (e.g., lower average deviation for saturation molalities).\n- **Limitation:** Cannot calculate solution density.\n\n**ePC-SAFT Model:**\n- Accurately predicted vapor pressure and liquid density of several salt solutions.\n- Considered more general due to its capability for volumetric calculations (density).\n- Accuracy could be significantly improved through specific regression of ion parameters (e.g., for strontium).\n\n**Overall:**\n- Both models demonstrated acceptable predictive capability for engineering applications across different ranges of pressure, temperature, concentration, and salt types.\n- The choice of ePC-SAFT parameters significantly impacted its accuracy; parameters from Held et al. [1] generally outperformed those from Cameretti et al. [29] for vapor pressure.\n- While ePC-SAFT in prediction mode (without binary interaction parameter adjustment) might show higher deviations for solubility compared to Pitzer, its ability to perform volumetric calculations makes it a more comprehensive tool.",
