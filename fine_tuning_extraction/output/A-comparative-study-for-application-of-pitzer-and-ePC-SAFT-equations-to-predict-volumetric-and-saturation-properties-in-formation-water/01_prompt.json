      "question": "How accurate was the ePC-SAFT model in predicting liquid density for single-salt solutions, and what was a key advantage over the Pitzer model?",
      "answer": "The ePC-SAFT model showed promising accuracy in predicting liquid density for single-salt solutions: NaBr (1.13% average relative deviation), KCl (0.70% average relative deviation), NaCl (1.02% average relative deviation), and Na2SO4 (0.36% average relative deviation). A key advantage is that the Pitzer model cannot estimate liquid density, making ePC-SAFT more comprehensive for volumetric calculations.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper explicitly states these average relative deviations for ePC-SAFT and highlights the inability of the Pitzer model to calculate liquid density, establishing ePC-SAFT's superior capability in this specific area.",

      "question": "What were the average relative deviations for vapor pressure predictions using ePC-SAFT for two-salt mixtures, and which parameter set performed better?",
      "answer": "For aqueous mixtures of NaCl and KBr, the average relative deviation for vapor pressure predictions using ePC-SAFT parameters from Held et al. [1] was 0.75%, significantly better than the 3.18% deviation observed with parameters from Cameretti et al. [29]. Similarly, for mixtures of NaBr and KCl, Held et al. [1] parameters resulted in an average relative deviation of 0.74%, outperforming Cameretti et al. [29] (3.22% deviation).\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper directly compares the performance of two different ePC-SAFT parameter sets, showing a clear preference for those from Held et al.

Saturation molality deviations ranged from 0.04% to 0.38%, and activity coefficient deviations ranged from 0.02% to 1.80% (Table 1).\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper presents a direct comparison (Table 1) of its Pitzer model calculations with those from Silvester and Pitzer [19], explicitly stating that the deviations were \"small\" and indicating \"correct equilibrium calculation of saturation molality and activity coefficient.\"",

It also accurately predicted the NaCl, NH4Cl, H2O system at 323.15 K and 373.15 K compared to experimental data from Farelo et al.

While the Pitzer model performed better in some solubility predictions (when ePC-SAFT was used in prediction mode without adjustment), ePC-SAFT's capacity for volumetric properties makes it a more comprehensive tool for engineering applications.\n\n**Reasoning:** The conclusion section explicitly states that \"ePC-SAFT can be regarded as more general as it can be used for volumetric calculations\" and highlights that \"It is not possible to calculate density using the Pitzer model,\" positioning ePC-SAFT as having broader utility despite Pitzer's strong performance in its specific domain.",

This super-saturation can significantly decrease injection performance by adversely affecting reservoir properties like permeability and porosity, highlighting the importance of accurate prediction models for preventing scale in oil and gas fields.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper explicitly states that water injection often leads to scale deposition due to mixing of incompatible waters, and the tables (8-11) quantitatively show the decrease in solubility, which directly supports the conclusion that scale formation is a significant issue addressed by these predictions.",
