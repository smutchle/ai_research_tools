      "question": "What is a primary limitation of the Pitzer model highlighted in this study?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitation:** The Pitzer model cannot directly calculate changes in volumetric properties of solutions, such as liquid density. This means it cannot provide a full functional prediction using a unique model for both equilibrium and volumetric properties.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper explicitly states: \"For example, the density of electrolyte solutions cannot be calculated from the Pitzer model (or the other common activity coefficient models).\" and later, \"Therefore, to have the full functional prediction using a unique model, application of ePC-SAFT is inevitable.\" This highlights a practical limitation for comprehensive engineering applications.",

      "question": "How do the prediction capabilities of ePC-SAFT compare to the Pitzer model for saturation molalities (solubility)?",
      "answer": "**Potential Criticism/Methodological Limitation:** The average deviation for saturation molalities from experimental values using ePC-SAFT was 5.7%, while for the Pitzer model, it was significantly lower at 0.3%. This suggests that, without further adjustment, the Pitzer model provided more accurate solubility predictions in this comparative study.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper directly reports these deviation percentages in Table 4 and the surrounding text, stating \"The average deviation percent from the experimental values for saturation molalities for different salts using ePC-SAFT is 5.7%, while this value is 0.3% for the Pitzer model.\" This is a direct, quantitative weakness for ePC-SAFT in *prediction mode* compared to the Pitzer model.",

      "question": "What is a key scientific debate concerning the Pitzer model's fundamental approach?",
      "answer": "**Scientific Debate:** The Pitzer model is a \"semi-empirical Gibbs-excess model,\" meaning it combines theoretical basis with adjustable empirical parameters. This contrasts with more theoretically derived equations of state like ePC-SAFT, leading to a debate about the trade-offs between empirical fitting accuracy for specific conditions and broader theoretical generality.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper describes Pitzer as \"partly empirical\" and contrasts it with \"EOSs with sound theoretical backgrounds from statistical thermodynamics\" like ePC-SAFT. This dichotomy between empirical models that fit data well within their fitted range and theoretical models aiming for broader predictability is a classic debate in chemical thermodynamics.",

      "question": "What assumption in the ePC-SAFT model's earlier strategies could be a point of criticism, and how was it addressed in later work?",
      "answer": "**Potential Criticism/Methodological Limitation:** Earlier ePC-SAFT strategies assumed the solvent dielectric constant to be independent of salt or acid concentration. This can be an oversimplification, especially for mixtures with ionic liquids, as noted by Bülow et al. [36], who then incorporated a concentration-dependent dielectric constant.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper mentions that Bülow et al. [36] \"implemented an approach to account for a concentration-dependent dielectric constant into ePC-SAFT for modeling liquid–liquid equilibria of binary mixtures containing water and hydrophobic ionic liquids where neglecting the influence of concentration on dielectric constant was an over-simplification.\" This identifies a recognized limitation or simplifying assumption that can lead to inaccuracies.",

      "question": "Why might the ePC-SAFT model's initial performance be considered a weakness in this study, and what is the authors' counter-argument?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitation / Potential Criticism:** When predicting saturation molalities, ePC-SAFT exhibited a higher average deviation (5.7%) compared to the Pitzer model (0.3%). This could be seen as a weakness. However, the authors counter-argue that ePC-SAFT was used \"in prediction mode without any binary interaction parameters\" and that \"Adjustment of these interaction coefficients would certainly improve the results.\"\n\n**Reasoning:** This is directly stated in the \"Results and Discussion\" and \"Conclusion\" sections. It's a key limitation of the *comparative methodology* (not optimizing ePC-SAFT fully) and simultaneously a defense by the authors, highlighting the model's potential.",

      "question": "What is a major advantage of the ePC-SAFT model over the Pitzer model that addresses a significant gap in the Pitzer model's capabilities?",
      "answer": "**Potential Controversy (as Pitzer lacks this):** Unlike the Pitzer model, ePC-SAFT can calculate solution density and saturation pressure, making it capable of predicting volumetric properties. This is a critical advantage for comprehensive engineering applications where density is a necessary property.\n\n**Reasoning:** The abstract states \"ePC-SAFT shows promising accuracy. The average relative deviation for prediction of liquid density (which cannot be estimated with the Pitzer model)...\" The conclusion reiterates: \"The ePC-SAFT can be regarded as more general as it can be used for volumetric calculations. It is not possible to calculate density using the Pitzer model.\" This is a fundamental difference in model capability.",

      "question": "What specific assumption is made regarding ion behavior during vapor pressure calculations using ePC-SAFT, and what are its implications?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitation / Alternative Interpretation:** For vapor pressure calculations, it is assumed that \"all the ions stay in the liquid phase,\" meaning the vapor phase is considered pure component gas (water). This simplifies the calculation but might not accurately represent systems where some ion volatilization could occur, potentially affecting the calculated equilibrium.\n\n**Reasoning:** Section 3, \"ePC-SAFT Model and Validation,\" explicitly states: \"It is assumed that all the ions stay in the liquid phase. This means that the vapor phase is the pure component gas.\" While practical for simplifying the model, this is an idealization.",

      "question": "What methodological approach was used to determine or refine ePC-SAFT parameters for strontium, and what might be a general concern about such optimization procedures?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitation / Scientific Debate:** A \"stochastic regression procedure\" utilizing simulated annealing (SA) optimization was employed to determine improved ePC-SAFT parameters for the strontium ion. While effective for finding optimized parameters, optimization techniques like SA involve trade-offs between finding global minima and computational cost, and the resulting parameters are specific to the experimental data they were fitted against.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper details the use of \"stochastic regression procedure\" and \"simulated annealing (SA) optimization\" for strontium parameters. SA is known for escaping local minima but can be computationally intensive and results are tied to the objective function and data used.",

      "question": "What evidence suggests the choice of ePC-SAFT parameter sets significantly impacts model accuracy?",
      "answer": "**Alternative Interpretation / Methodological Concern:** The study found that ePC-SAFT parameters from Held et al. [1] provided \"more accurate predictions\" for vapor pressure of mixed salt solutions (e.g., NaCl and KBr, NaBr and KCl) compared to parameters from Cameretti et al. [29]. This highlights that the specific set of parameters used can be as crucial as the model itself for accuracy.\n\n**Reasoning:** Figs. 5 and 6 and their accompanying text clearly show and state that \"One important conclusion is that ePC-SAFT parameters of Held et al. [1] give more accurate predictions than those from Cameretti et al. [29].\" This implies parameter dependency.",

      "question": "How does the Pitzer model's reliance on empirical parameters present a challenge for its application in multi-electrolyte solutions at extreme conditions?",
      "answer": "**Methodological Limitation / Potential Criticism:** The Pitzer model includes six empirical parameters for multi-electrolyte solutions that are often \"not specified because of lack of experimental data,\" particularly at high pressures and temperatures. This limits its applicability and predictive power under such uncharacterized conditions.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper states: \"Another limitation of this model is that it includes six empirical parameters for multi-electrolyte solutions, at high pressure and temperature.

      "question": "What is a potential criticism regarding the \"predictive capability\" of ePC-SAFT in the context of this study's comparison?",
      "answer": "**Alternative Interpretation / Scientific Debate:** While ePC-SAFT is lauded for its theoretical basis and generality, its \"predictive capability\" in this study's comparison for saturation molality resulted in a 5.7% deviation, much higher than the Pitzer model's 0.3%. This suggests that \"predictive\" does not always equate to \"more accurate\" when compared to models that have been extensively fitted to specific types of data.\n\n**Reasoning:** This circles back to the 5.7% vs 0.3% deviation for solubility. While authors attribute it to using ePC-SAFT in prediction mode (without adjustment), a critic might interpret this as a practical shortcoming of its \"predictive\" power for *this specific property* relative to the Pitzer model.",

      "question": "What is the main argument for favoring ePC-SAFT despite its lower accuracy in some comparisons in this study?",
      "answer": "**Scientific Debate / Alternative Interpretation:** The primary argument for ePC-SAFT, despite its higher deviations in some cases compared to the Pitzer model, is its \"sound theoretical background from statistical thermodynamics\" and its ability to provide a \"full functional prediction\" including volumetric properties (like density), which the Pitzer model cannot. This generality is considered a significant advantage for broader engineering applications.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper emphasizes ePC-SAFT's theoretical basis and its ability to calculate density and saturation pressure, which the Pitzer model cannot. This inherent generality is positioned as a key advantage that makes it \"inevitable\" for certain applications, even if it requires further parameter tuning for optimal accuracy in specific scenarios.",

      "answer": "**Methodological Limitation:** The Pitzer model's activity coefficients \"cannot be determined directly\" for their pressure-dependency. This reliance on semi-empirical parameters means that specific fitting is often needed for different pressure and temperature ranges, which can be challenging due to data scarcity.\n\n**Reasoning:** The paper states: \"Moreover, pressure-dependency of activity coefficients cannot be determined directly.\" This implies a need for more empirical fitting across different P/T conditions, which can be a practical constraint.",

The authors' choice not to adjust binary interaction parameters for ePC-SAFT could be seen as a methodological choice affecting the \"reliability\" of the direct comparison of *un-tuned predictive power*.\n\n**Reasoning:** The phrase \"reliable implementation\" appears in the abstract. However, the subsequent revelation that ePC-SAFT was used \"in prediction mode without any binary interaction coefficients\" and that adjusting them \"would certainly improve the results\" creates a tension.

While validation against various single and two-salt mixtures from literature is performed, the generalizability of the models' performance to the full diversity of \"formation water\" compositions found globally, or to other complex industrial brines, might be questioned without broader validation datasets.\n\n**Reasoning:** The abstract and introduction emphasize \"Formation water\" and \"Injection water.\" While the study validates against standard salts, the phrase \"There are few studies for ePC-SAFT application in formation water\" (in introduction) implicitly acknowledges a limitation in prior research, which this study addresses but might not fully resolve for all possible variations.",
