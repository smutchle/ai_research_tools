      "question": "What parameters and numerical methods were used for the ePC-SAFT model calculations?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- **Pure-Component Parameters:** For non-associating components, three parameters: segment number (m_seg), segment diameter (σ), and dispersion energy (u/k_B). For associating components (like water), two additional parameters: association energy (εⁱⁱ/⁲⁲⁶⁶⁷⁷) and association volume (υⁱⁱ/⁲⁲⁶⁶⁷⁷). (See Appendix B, Table 16).\n- **Water Parameters:** From Held et al. [1], with a temperature-dependent segment diameter σ_T,W (Eq. 23) to account for density anomaly (valid for 273.15 K to 373.15 K).\n- **Ion Parameters:** Primarily from Held et al. [1] (Table 17) for validation, with specific strontium parameters regressed in this work (Table 13, 14).\n- **Numerical Methods:\n**    - **Density Calculation:** Determined iteratively by adjusting the reduced density (η) until the calculated pressure (P_cal) from the SAFT compressibility equation matched the system pressure (P_sys). This involves one compressibility factor calculation without iteration for equilibrium.\n    - **Vapor Pressure Calculation:** Based on fugacity equivalency for water in the liquid and vapor phases, assuming ions remain in the liquid phase and the vapor phase is pure component gas. It involves solving one equation (fugacity equivalency) for one variable (ln P) using iterative numerical methods (Figure 4).\n\n**Reasoning:** The ePC-SAFT model, with its theoretical foundation in statistical thermodynamics, allows for calculation of solution density and saturation pressure, which are beyond the capabilities of the Pitzer model. The use of temperature-dependent parameters for water and specific numerical iterative procedures ensures accurate representation of real fluid behavior.",

      "question": "Describe the experimental method for optimizing ePC-SAFT parameters for the strontium ion.",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- **Objective:** To obtain considerably improved ePC-SAFT parameters for the strontium ion (Sr²⁺).\n- **Experimental Data Source:** Mean Ionic Activity Coefficients (MIACs) of aqueous strontium chloride, strontium bromide, strontium iodide, strontium nitrate, and strontium perchlorate solutions.\n- **Temperature:** 298.15 K.\n- **Data Origin:** Experimental data from Rard and Miller [38].\n- **Optimization Algorithm:** Simulated Annealing (SA) optimization [37].\n- **Objective Function (OF):** Minimization of the average absolute relative deviation between experimental (γ_exp_k) and calculated (γ_cal_k) MIAC values: OF = (1/NP) Σk=1 to NP |(γ_exp_k - γ_cal_k) / γ_exp_k| (Eq. 24).\n- **Parameters Optimized:** Ionic diameter (σ_i), ionic dispersion energy (u_i/k_B), and the binary interaction coefficient between water and Sr²⁺ (k_ion-water). Also, binary interaction coefficients between Sr²⁺ and anions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻, ClO₄⁻, NO₃⁻) were regressed (Table 13 and Table 14).\n- **Initial Parameter Guess:** Multipliers (between 0.8 and 1.2) of initial ePC-SAFT parameters were used.\n- **Optimization Procedure:** The OF iteratively calls the ePC-SAFT model to calculate saturation pressure and MIAC for each experimental point. The SA algorithm then proposes new multipliers, accepting improvements and sometimes accepting “uphill” steps via a Boltzmann probability function (Metropolis technique) to escape local minima (Figure 9).\n\n**Quality Control:**\n- The optimized parameters significantly reduced the absolute relative deviation for MIACs compared to previous parameters (e.g., for strontium chloride, deviation reduced from 19.73% to 6.98%). Visual comparison showed better agreement with experimental data (Figures 10, 11, 12).\n\n**Reasoning:** Prior ePC-SAFT parameters for strontium from Held et al. [1] showed poor agreement with experimental MIACs. This regression procedure, based on a comprehensive optimization algorithm, was crucial to improve the accuracy of ePC-SAFT for strontium-containing solutions, enhancing its predictive capability for complex formation water systems.",

In some instances, the Pitzer model performed better, but ePC-SAFT was used in prediction mode without binary interaction parameters, which could be adjusted for improvement.\n- **Scope of Application:** Both models demonstrated acceptable predictive capability across different ranges of pressure, temperature, concentration, and salt types relevant to engineering applications.\n- **Volumetric Calculations:** ePC-SAFT was capable of accurately calculating vapor pressure and liquid density of various salt solutions, a key advantage over the Pitzer model, which cannot estimate solution density. This makes ePC-SAFT more general for volumetric calculations.\n- **Parameter Accuracy:** ePC-SAFT parameters from Held et al.

      "question": "What strategy was adopted for modeling ions within the ePC-SAFT framework?",
      "answer": "**Experimental Protocol:**\n- **Dissociation:** Salts and acids were assumed to be completely dissociated into their ions.\n- **Repulsion Interactions:** Repulsion among ions, as well as between solvents and ions, was considered.\n- **Ion Diameter:** The diameters of solvated ions were assumed to be temperature-independent.\n- **Dispersion Interactions:** Dispersion interactions between ions and solvents were accounted for. Crucially, the “second strategy” from Held et al. [34] was employed, which explicitly considered dispersion between anions and cations. Dispersion between two anions or two cations was not considered.\n- **Ion as Single Particle:** Each ion was treated as a single particle, meaning the segment number (m_ion) was set to 1.\n- **Electrostatic Interactions:** Described by a Debye–Hückel contribution to the residual Helmholtz energy.\n- **Dielectric Constant:** The solvent dielectric constant, required for the Debye–Hückel contribution, was assumed to depend only on the solvent and temperature, independent of salt or acid concentration (with a note on potential oversimplification).\n\n**Reasoning:** This detailed modeling strategy for ions within ePC-SAFT aims to provide a robust theoretical framework for electrolyte solutions. Explicitly considering dispersion between cations and anions, along with the Debye–Hückel term, allows for a more accurate representation of complex ionic interactions compared to simpler approaches.
