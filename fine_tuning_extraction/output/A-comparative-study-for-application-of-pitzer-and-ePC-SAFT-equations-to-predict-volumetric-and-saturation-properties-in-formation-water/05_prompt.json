It initializes with a guess for molalities, then iteratively refines them. In each step:\n1.  **Activity coefficients** for all species are calculated using the current molalities (represented by `pitzer_calculate_activity_coefficients` placeholder, which is highly complex in a real Pitzer implementation).\n2.  The **`g` equation(s)** (Equation 10) are formulated, which quantify the deviation from equilibrium for the precipitating salt(s). For simplicity, the provided `pitzer_setup_g_equations` is structured for a single salt.\n3.  A **Jacobian matrix** (or a single derivative for a single-variable problem) is computed numerically using central differencing. This derivative indicates how the `g` function changes with respect to the molality variables.\n4.  The molality vector (or the target salt molality) is **updated** using the Newton-Raphson formula (`x_new = x_old - g(x_old) / g'(x_old)`).\n5.  **Convergence** is checked based on the change in molality. If the change is below a specified tolerance, the solution has converged.\n\nIt's important to note that a full multi-component Pitzer solubility solver is significantly more complex, involving a system of `g` equations and a multi-dimensional Jacobian matrix. The provided code focuses on the core iterative process for a simplified single-salt scenario to illustrate the algorithm from the paper.",

The provided code implements this summation. However, the paper explicitly states that the detailed expressions for these individual contributions are available in other literature (e.g., Gross and Sadowski [27], Huang and Radosz [28], Cameretti et al. [29]). Therefore, the code uses placeholder functions for `calculate_ahc`, `calculate_adisp`, `calculate_aassoc`, and `calculate_aion`. This approach effectively demonstrates the *structure* of the ePC-SAFT model's core thermodynamic potential, highlighting its modularity and the additive nature of its energy terms, even if the specific internal calculations for each term are not directly extracted from this paper.",

The unit conversion factor `(10^10 Å/m)^3` is explicitly included to ensure consistency between Ångstrom-based number density and Pascal pressure units.\n-   `calculate_compressibility_factor_epc_saft` implements Equation (14), showing that `Z` is the sum of `1` (ideal gas contribution) and various excess compressibility factor contributions (`Zhc`, `Zdisp`, `Zassoc`, `Zion`). Similar to the Helmholtz energy, the detailed expressions for these `Z` components are complex and referenced to other papers, so placeholder functions are used (`calculate_zhc`, `calculate_zdisp`, `calculate_zassoc`, `calculate_zion`).\n-   `calculate_zion` provides a structural implementation for the ionic contribution (Equation 17), which depends on a `pelec` term (ionic pressure contribution). The paper's Equation 15 for `pelec` is slightly ambiguous due to formatting, so `calculate_zion` conceptually shows its relation while acknowledging the detailed `pelec` calculation would come from the referenced `Cameretti et al.` paper. \n\nThis modular approach clearly depicts the computational flow for pressure and compressibility factor within ePC-SAFT, based on the principle of additivity of contributions.",
