The high %ARD values, particularly for critical pressure, numerically demonstrate the significant overestimation by the original model, thereby establishing the primary motivation for introducing a modification (i.e., a new volume translation parameter) to improve critical point reproduction and overall density predictions in the study.",

Similar to Figure 3, it shows a \"bell curve\" shape, with the needed shift peaking near Tr=1 and then becoming nearly constant at higher temperatures.\n\n**Reasoning:** This figure further reinforces the findings of Figure 3 by extending the temperature range, demonstrating that the needed volume shift exhibits a distinct non-linear, Gaussian-like pattern. The consistent bell-curve shape across various pressures confirms that a constant or linear volume translation is inadequate and validates the study's decision to employ a non-linear, temperature-dependent Gaussian-like function (Eq. 5) as the volume translation model to accurately capture this complex behavior.",

This shift is minimal far from the critical temperature (Tr=1) but increases sharply as the temperature approaches the critical point, reflecting the complex behavior of fluids in that region.\n- The model's symmetry around Tr=1 ensures a physically plausible and robust correction across the temperature range.\n\n**Reasoning:** Previous volume translation models (constant or linear) failed to capture the complex, non-linear behavior of CO2 density near its critical point. The Gaussian-like function's ability to provide a strong correction near the critical point and become constant elsewhere is a technical breakthrough that allows for a much more accurate match with experimental molar volume residuals, leading to enhanced density predictions across a wide range of conditions.

      "question": "What specific thermodynamic inconsistency needs to be investigated when introducing temperature-dependent volume translation into SAFT-type EOSs?",
      "answer": "The potential for thermodynamic inconsistency, such as the crossing of isotherms in the pressure-volume diagram, should be investigated when a temperature-dependent volume translation technique is introduced into SAFT-type EOSs. This is because various degrees of volume shifts are required for different isotherms, which can limit the model's application for calculating other thermophysical properties.",

      "answer": "**Literature Background:** Thermodynamic consistency, particularly isotherm crossing in pressure-volume diagrams and numerical pitfalls like multiple phase equilibria or negative heat capacities at high pressures, is a known issue for SAFT-type EOS (Polishuk, 2011, 2010; Kalikhman et al., 2010) and volume-translated CEOS (Chen and Li, 2020, 2021; Pfohl, 1999; Shi et al., 2018; Shi and Li, 2016; Young et al., 2017). Temperature-dependent volume translation can exacerbate this issue.\n  **Current Study's Approach:** This study tests the VT-CPPC-SAFT model for crossover issues using criteria like those developed by Shi and Li (2016) for CEOS. The results show that the VT-CPPC-SAFT model does not exhibit isotherm crossing at pressures below 90.980 MPa (10Pc). However, crossover does appear at higher pressures (12.335Pc or 90.980 MPa) in the temperature range of 0.85Tr-0.9Tr.\n  **Implication:** This establishes a safe application range for the proposed model, acknowledging the inherent challenges of thermodynamic consistency in such complex models.",

      "question": "Summarize the overall contribution of this research and its implications for future work.",
      "answer": "**Overall Contribution:** This study successfully developed the VT-CPPC-SAFT model by coupling a nonlinear temperature-dependent volume translation with the existing critical-point constrained parametrization method (Anoune et al., 2021). This advancement allows the model to simultaneously and accurately reproduce CO2's critical temperature and pressure *and* provide significantly improved predictions for liquid-phase, supercritical-phase, vapor pressure, and saturated densities. It achieves the smallest overall %AAD (1.078%) for density predictions across all phases compared to original PC-SAFT, CPPC-SAFT, and I-PC-SAFT.\n  **Positioning and Future Work:** This work addresses a critical long-standing trade-off in SAFT-type EOSs (critical point vs. density accuracy). The proposed strategy can be extended to model other pure compounds in future studies. However, the development of a single SAFT-type EOS model that can simultaneously and accurately describe *all* thermodynamic properties, including higher-order derivative properties, remains a necessary task and a direction for future research.",

The explicit citation of the NIST database as the sole source of experimental data ensures data transparency and allows for independent verification of inputs. The detailed mathematical description of the new model, along with the specified parameterization and regression protocols (including the objective function and data ranges), provides a solid foundation for computational reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the rigorous comparative analysis against three distinct, well-established models, using consistent metrics, significantly strengthens the findings' credibility and demonstrates the model's superiority. The inclusion of CRediT authorship and a conflict of interest statement also enhances transparency. However, a notable limitation for full computational reproducibility and broader adoption is the absence of publicly shared code. While the methods are described, providing the actual code would drastically reduce barriers to replication, facilitate error checking, and enable easier application or extension of the model by the wider scientific community.",
