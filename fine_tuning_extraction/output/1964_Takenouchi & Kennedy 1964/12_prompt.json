      "question": "What overall information is provided about reproducibility, data availability, and validation procedures in this study?",
      "answer": "**Reproducibility:** The paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental apparatus, temperature and pressure control, sampling methods, and analytical procedures, which are crucial for reproducibility. It also explicitly discusses the time required to achieve equilibrium, a key factor for replicating results.\n\n**Data Availability:** No explicit data repositories or code sharing platforms are mentioned. All experimental results are presented directly within the paper in tables and figures. The authors state that coexisting compositions were taken from 'smoothed plots' of the experimental results.\n\n**Validation Procedures:** Validation is primarily demonstrated through extensive comparisons with prior published and unpublished work by other researchers (e.g., Malinin, Todheide, Wiebe and Gaddy, Ellis and Golding). The authors report both agreements and, importantly, discrepancies with existing data, providing detailed explanations for these differences, such as the effect of stirring in apparatus design. Internal consistency checks (e.g., samples from top/bottom agreeing at supercritical conditions, agreement of duplicate liquid phase determinations) also contribute to validation.\n\n**Research Rigor & Transparency:** The study exhibits strong rigor for its time by meticulously describing methods, calibrating instruments (pressure gauge), performing purity checks on reagents, acknowledging experimental challenges (e.g., gas phase sampling scatter, equilibrium times) and how they were addressed. Transparency is high due to the direct presentation of all data, detailed methodological explanations, and a critical comparison of results with the existing literature, including a frank discussion and proposed reasons for disagreements.",

    {
      "question": "What information is provided regarding code sharing or computational reproducibility?",
      "answer": "The paper does not provide any information regarding code sharing. Given the publication year (1964), the concept of sharing computational code or scripts was not standard practice, and the analysis primarily involved direct experimental measurements and calculations based on established physical chemistry equations. There is no mention of custom software or analysis pipelines in the modern sense.",

      "question": "What replication protocols are described in the methodology?",
      "answer": "The paper provides detailed experimental methods that act as replication protocols, although not explicitly named as such. These include:\n- **Apparatus Design:** The autoclave design is stated to be \"the same as that previously described (Sourirajan and Kennedy, 1962)\", implying a standardized and published setup.\n- **Temperature Control:** The electric furnace was regulated with a precision of \\textasciitilde 0.8°C. Two chromel-alumel thermocouples measured temperatures with a Leeds and Northrop type K potentiometer, showing a normal difference of less than 0.5°C.\n- **Pressure Measurement:** Pressures were determined using a 15-inch Heise Bourdon Tube gauge (0-3000 bars, 4 bars scale interval) previously calibrated against a dead weight free piston gauge, with \\textasciitilde 2 bars hysteresis.\n- **Sampling Procedure:** Explicit details are given on filling the autoclave, introducing CO\\_2, alternately withdrawing samples from top and bottom, taking three or four samples per period, and discarding the initial flow (0.3-1.0 g) to prevent contamination from capillary tubes.\n- **Equilibrium Attainment:** The study found that equilibrium times varied from 6 hours (high temperatures/low pressures) to \"substantially longer times\" at higher pressures/lower temperatures (e.g., at least 3 days at 200°C, more than 1 week at 110°C) due to increasing viscosity and decreasing diffusion speeds. This crucial detail informs potential replications on required experimental duration.",

    {
      "question": "How was the precision and consistency of the analytical measurements ensured?",
      "answer": "The precision and consistency of analytical measurements were addressed through:\n- **Duplicate Determinations:** \"In general duplicate determinations of liquid phase composition agreed within the error of titration and weighing.\"\n- **Multiple Sampling:** \"Three or four samples were taken at each sampling period.\"\n- **Titration Method:** Carbon dioxide content was determined by titration with standardized hydrochloric acid solution (Kolthoff and Sandell, 1952).\n- **Acknowledged Variability:** The authors transparently noted that \"deviation from sample to sample under presumably duplicate conditions was considerably larger\" for the gas phase, attributing it to condensation, and stating that \"deviation of results in the gas phase was reduced by sampling at very low rates.\"",

      "question": "What validation procedures involved comparison with previously published work?",
      "answer": "Extensive validation was performed by comparing the results with prior studies:\n- **Malinin's Data (1959):** The authors' data is \"in good agreement with early unpublished data on the system H\\_2O-CO\\_2 by Knight and Kennedy\" and \"almost exact agreement where our experimental ranges overlap in the liquid region\" with Malinin's published data. Gas phase data is in \"reasonably good agreement\" with Malinin's.\n- **Todheide's Data (ms):** Comparisons were made with Todheide's concurrent unpublished work. While liquid phase data showed \"almost exact agreement,\" gas phase data and the critical curve showed significant discrepancies; their critical curve lies \\textasciitilde 10 mole percent lower CO\\_2 concentration.\n- **Wiebe and Gaddy (1939):** Data for 50°C and 100°C isotherms from Wiebe and Gaddy were integrated and shown in Figure 7 for comparison.\n- **Ellis and Golding (1963):** Henry's law constants derived from this study were presented alongside \"Data of Ellis and Golding (1963)\" in Table 4.\n- **Franck and Todheide (1959):** Their work on supercritical mixtures was cited for general behavioral comparison.\n- **General System Behavior:** The critical curve characteristics were compared to other binary systems with polar and non-polar components (e.g., SO\\_2-N\\_2, N\\_2-NH\\_3, CH\\_4-NH\\_3) studied by Krichevsky and Ziclis (1943, 1947).",

    {
      "question": "How did the authors address and explain discrepancies with other studies, particularly Todheide's data?",
      "answer": "The authors openly discussed discrepancies with Todheide's data, stating that their data was \"not in accord with the results of Todheide especially at lower temperatures\" and that their critical curve lay at \"about 10 mole percent lower CO\\_2 concentration.\" They critically analyzed the potential reasons for these differences:\n- **Experimental Technique:** They explicitly stated: \"We believe that the difference between our results and the results of Todheide lies in a fundamental difference in experimental technique.\"\n- **Stirring vs. No Stirring:** They noted that Todheide's apparatus included \"internal stirrers\" while theirs did not. This was directly linked to equilibrium attainment times; Todheide reported 1 hour for equilibrium, whereas the authors found \"substantially longer times were required for equilibrium\" (up to >1 week at 110°C) without stirring, especially at higher pressures and lower temperatures where viscosity and diffusion speeds are low. This explanation highlights a crucial aspect of experimental rigor and reproducibility.",

    {
      "question": "How did the authors incorporate and validate the use of theoretical models in their analysis?",
      "answer": "The authors applied and discussed the applicability of theoretical models:\n- **Solubility Equation (Equation 2):** They used an equation for the solubility of slightly soluble gases in volatile solvents (from Krichevsky and Kasarnovsky, 1935, and Dodge and Newton, 1939) to calculate Henry's law constant and apparent molal volume.\n- **Fugacity Data Source:** The necessary fugacity values for calculations were taken from published diagrams by Majumdar and Roy (1956).\n- **Applicability Range:** They clearly stated the model's limitations: \"It is clear from figure 12 that equation (2) is applicable for a wide range of pressures in this binary system at temperatures below 250°C. At higher temperatures than 250°C... the results can no longer be expressed by straight lines\" because conditions deviate too much from the model's assumptions.",
